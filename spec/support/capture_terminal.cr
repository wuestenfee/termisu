# Terminal subclass that captures all writes for verification.
#
# Useful for testing Terminal output including escape sequences
# like BSU/ESU for synchronized updates.
#
# Example:
# ```
# terminal = CaptureTerminal.new(sync_updates: true)
# terminal.set_cell(0, 0, 'X')
# terminal.render
# terminal.output.should contain(Termisu::Terminal::BSU)
# ```
