# Terminal resize event source.
#
# Monitors terminal size changes via polling and SIGWINCH signal handling.
# Generates `Event::Resize` events with old and new dimensions for
# efficient partial redraws.
#
# ## Usage
#
# ```
# # Create with a size provider (typically backend.size)
# resize = Termisu::Event::Source::Resize.new(-> { backend.size })
#
# loop = Termisu::Event::Loop.new
# loop.add_source(resize)
# loop.start
#
# while event = loop.output.receive?
#   case event
#   when Termisu::Event::Resize
#     puts "Terminal resized to #{event.width}x#{event.height}"
#     if event.changed?
#       puts "Changed from #{event.old_width}x#{event.old_height}"
#     end
#   end
# end
# ```
#
# ## Detection Strategy
#
# Uses a hybrid approach:
# 1. **SIGWINCH Signal**: Sets the `@signal_received` atomic flag; the
#    polling fiber checks this flag each iteration and skips the sleep
#    when set, providing near-immediate resize detection.
# 2. **Polling Fallback**: Periodic size checks (default 100ms) catch
#    resizes that signals might miss.
#
# ## Runtime Configuration
#
# The poll interval can be changed while the source is running via
# `poll_interval=`. Changes take effect on the next poll cycle.
#
# ## Thread Safety
#
# Uses `Atomic(Bool)` for the running state. Safe to call `start`/`stop`
# from different fibers. Uses `compare_and_set` for idempotent lifecycle
# operations - calling `start` twice or `stop` twice is safe.
#
# ## Lifecycle
#
# The source can be restarted after stopping. Each `start` resets the
# signal flag and reinstalls the SIGWINCH handler.
