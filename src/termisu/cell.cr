# Cell represents a single character cell in the terminal buffer.
#
# Cell contains:
# - grapheme: The Unicode grapheme cluster (single grapheme for leading cells)
# - width: Display column width (0, 1, or 2)
# - continuation: True for trailing cell of a wide grapheme
# - fg: Foreground color (supports ANSI-8, ANSI-256, and RGB)
# - bg: Background color (supports ANSI-8, ANSI-256, and RGB)
# - attr: Text attributes (bold, underline, etc.)
#
# ## Grapheme and Continuation Cells
#
# Wide characters (CJK, emoji) occupy 2 columns. The Cell model represents this:
# - Leading cell: `continuation = false`, `width = 2`, `grapheme` contains the full grapheme
# - Trailing cell: `continuation = true`, `width = 0`, `grapheme` is empty
#
# Example:
# ```
# # Leading cell for "中" (width auto-calculated as 2)
# lead = Termisu::Cell.new("中")
# lead.grapheme      # => "中"
# lead.width         # => 2
# lead.continuation? # => false
#
# # Trailing continuation cell
# trail = Termisu::Cell.continuation
# trail.grapheme      # => ""
# trail.width         # => 0
# trail.continuation? # => true
# ```
#
# ## Compatibility (Public API)
#
# The `grapheme` property provides backward-compatible access:
# ```
# cell = Termisu::Cell.new("A")
# cell.grapheme # => "A" (first codepoint of grapheme)
#
# continuation = Termisu::Cell.continuation
# continuation.grapheme # => "" (empty for continuation cells)
# ```

  # Creates a new Cell with the specified grapheme and colors.
  #
  # Parameters:
  # - grapheme: Unicode grapheme cluster to display (if multi-grapheme string is
  #   passed, only the first grapheme cluster is stored)
  # - continuation: True if this is a trailing cell of a wide grapheme
  # - fg: Foreground color (default: white)
  # - bg: Background color (default: default terminal color)
  # - attr: Text attributes (default: None)
  #
  # Note: Width is derived from grapheme content to ensure consistency.
  # Continuation cells always have empty grapheme and width 0.
  #
  # Occupancy invariants enforced:
  # - Continuation cells: always empty grapheme, width 0
  # - Empty non-continuation: normalized to default space cell (width 1)
  # - Leading cells: width derived via grapheme_width (handles VS16, ZWJ, flags)
  # - Multi-grapheme strings: only first grapheme is stored; debug log warns of truncation
